Created the empty repo on github. Add the slide deck and all of the files at the command line (with gitbash) this includes the empty nojekyll file. In the directory do
git init
git add * 
git commit -a -m "Added all of the files"
git remote add origin *put in your github origin here*
git push origin master
Then make a branch with
git branch gh-pages
Then push the branch to gh with
git push origin gh-pages
